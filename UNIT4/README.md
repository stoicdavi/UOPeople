# This Unit focuses on FRUITFUL functions
- Fruitful functions -  have a return statement

## Covered terms
- Dead code - Code that appears after a return statement, or place that flow of execution can never reach
- Incremental development -  to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.
- recursion - calling an executing function inside the same function
